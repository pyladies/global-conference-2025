    "abstract": "What if the tools we use to predict disease risk don't work for entire populations, simply because very few people (studies) test them over there? That's the case for many polygenic risk score (PRS) models and pipelines, which often fail when applied to African genomes. PRS is a number that estimates how likely someone is to develop a disease based on their DNA. In this talk, I'll walk through how I, a self-taught bioinformatician, learner and currently a PhD. student, am using Python to build something better: a reproducible pipeline for PRS tools that center inclusion.\r\nMore than a technical talk, this is a story about learning, persistence and impact. I'll share how I use accessible Python libraries like argparse, pandas, subprocess and shutil to automate preprocessing, handle containerised PRS tools with Docker, and stitch everything together using workflows like Nextflow. Without waiting to be an expert, I am building a solution for breast cancer, a global health problem that affects millions of women around the world.\r\nThe tools I'm building are still a work in progress, but this talk will spotlight the imperfect, iterative process of building (while learning) pipelines that don't exclude underrepresented populations by design. I'll share how Python makes it possible to go from fragmented data to actionable results.\r\nThis talk is for anyone curious about bioinformatics, passionate about global inclusion or simply learning Python and wondering, \"What can I build that matters?\"",

    "abstract": "In Africa, getting inclusive education is still quite difficult, especially for kids with learning difficulties like dyslexia. Imprecise word comprehension and generally subpar reading performance are hallmarks of dyslexia, a neurological disease. It impacts a sizable portion of school-age children, with a higher prevalence in boys, putting them at lifetime risk for subpar academic achievement and low self-esteem.\r\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) believes that between 10% and 20% of people worldwide suffer with dyslexia, indicating that the disorder is highly prevalent. It might potentially be as high as 30% in low-income areas.\r\nIn traditional educational institutions, children with dyslexia frequently encounter obstacles that restrict their exposure to critical skills like programming, which are vital in the digital age. IT skills are a crucial tool to support dyslexic pupils because they can help them learn and reduce difficulties with identifying or confusing words and meaning. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of exposing students to IT skills, such as programming, especially those with special learning difficulties. Pupils with dyslexia typically have low expectations for their academic opportunities and low self-esteem. \r\n\r\nThis talk examines how Python's ease of use and adaptability might be utilized to produce educational materials and programming tools that are accessible to dyslexic kids in underdeveloped countries. These resources are perfect for countries with limited resources because they require less infrastructure for technology.\r\nJoin us as we explore python for inclusive education and creating a new generation of pupils who are masters of digital skills regardless of their situation and showing that coding is for everyone, breaking barriers and giving equal opportunities to dyslexic kids.",

This talk explores how we can apply feminist principles like transparency, consent, and equity to build more ethical data pipelines. Through real-world examples of harm caused by opaque and biased data systems, we\u2019ll examine how even routine ETL work can reinforce injustice. We\u2019ll then outline practical approaches for designing pipelines that center care and accountability covering techniques like schema minimization, anonymization in Python, and documenting data provenance. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of how to challenge extractive data practices and use their technical skills to push back against surveillance capitalism and systemic bias.",

    "abstract": "Around the world, billions of dollars are flowing into nature-based solutions to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation. But ensuring that these investments deliver real, measurable results is a major challenge. At the World Resources Institute (WRI), our Restoration Monitoring team is using Python to transform how restoration progress is tracked, verified, and shared, with the goal of bringing greater trust and transparency to the movement.\r\nThis talk will showcase how we combine Python\u2019s rich ecosystem of data science, geospatial, and AI/ML libraries to power the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of restoration activities under WRI\u2019s TerraFund program. Since 2022, TerraFund has channeled $32 million to nearly 200 restoration champions.\r\nI\u2019ll walk through our rule-based decision support system\u2014a Python tool built with requests and API-specific client libraries\u2014that integrates multiple data streams to determine which projects should undergo remote or field verification. This approach helps us reduce uncertainty, optimize field missions, and improve cost planning. As part of our remote verification protocol, we deploy state-of-the-art computer vision models on high-resolution Maxar imagery to label trees and saplings with bounding boxes. Our data production process uses Python-based pipelines to query, order, and process imagery, then run inference to detect trees. This enables automated tree counting at scale, turning terabytes of imagery into actionable project-level verification. Finally, results are integrated into TerraMatch, our end-to-end platform connecting funders and restoration champions, and making insights about progress publicly accessible.\r\nAttendees will learn how Python acts as the connective tissue across APIs, AI/ML models, and geospatial workflows, and how these tools are helping us build scalable, transparent monitoring systems.",

As a beginner programmer with a passion for data visualization design, I began exploring how to build interactive dashboards with Python and Dash \u2014 not just to keep coding, but to share stories that matter deeply to me. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I share key lessons learned so far \u2014 through a beginner\u2019s lens \u2014 the shift from a rough idea to a working concept, choosing data, structuring the dashboard, and finding the balance between clarity and aesthetics in my design decisions. I\u2019ll focus on one dashboard project as a case study to show what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how I adapted along the way. Specifically, I will focus on correlations between malaria risk in children under 5 in Nigeria and other key indicators such as climate change and access to water and sanitation. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll also share my personal experience of troubleshooting when nothing seems to work, and how I kept motivation up when hope was dim.

    "abstract": "Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, but understanding how it works under the hood can be a challenge. Even though it is open source, there are very few accessible resources to explore CPython\u2014its reference implementation in C\u2014and even fewer if English is not your first language. But what if, instead of writing `if`, we could write `si`? What if `print()` became `imprimir()`? And what if, while transforming Python into Spanish, we learned how Python itself is built?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore what CPython is and how to compile it, why Python is written in C instead of Python, and how its grammar and parser work. Finally, we\u2019ll put this knowledge into action by changing Python\u2019s keywords into Spanish\u2014`if` becomes `si`, `for` becomes `para`, and `while becomes `mientras`.\r\n\r\nBy learning how CPython works internally, you\u2019ll gain a deeper understanding of why certain things work (and why some errors happen), experiment with new language features, create your own extensions, and maybe even contribute back to CPython itself. And although it may sound intimidating, CPython is not an untouchable project\u2014you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s more approachable than you think.\r\n\r\nWhile the examples in this talk are in Spanish, the approach can be adapted to *any* natural language, including **yours**!\r\n\r\nThis talk is aimed at Python users with intermediate knowledge who are curious about how the language is implemented. No prior experience with C, compilers, or language theory is required\u2014just a willingness to learn something new.",

    "abstract": "Acquisition of satellite imagery, frequently becomes corrupted by various forms of noise, which degrades image quality and impedes accurate interpretation and subsequent analysis. This paper presents a novel, integrated approach for effective noise removal from such imagery, utilizing the capabilities of the Wavelet transform based thresholding, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and also autoencoders. The Wiener filter, proves adept at addressing stationary noise, particularly effective in suppressing additive Gaussian noise whilst preserving important details based on local statistics. Following this, SVDs are employed to exploit the inherent low-rank structure characteristic of natural images, enabling further noise reduction by reconstructing the image from its more significant singular values, thereby separating signal from noise components. Finally, an autoencoder, which is are powerful deep learning architecture, is then utilized for its capacity to learn complex, non-linear representations from noisy inputs. This data-driven strategy allows the autoencoder to effectively apprehend intricate noise patterns and reconstruct high-fidelity images, offering particular benefit for complex or non-stationary noise types where traditional filters may struggle. By combining these complementary techniques, the proposed methodology aims for superior noise suppression, the preservation of crucial image features, and the enhancement of overall visual quality and analytical utility of satellite images. Expected results demonstrate significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and perceptual quality compared to individual methods, highlighting the synergistic benefits of this combined framework.",

    "abstract": "Ever wondered what happens to your data after you delete your account? While the database might forget you, the AI models trained on your data still \"remember\" your patterns. This talk introduces machine unlearning - the fascinating field of teaching AI to truly forget.\r\n\r\nIn this beginner-friendly session, you'll discover why machine unlearning matters more than ever. From GDPR's \"right to be forgotten\" to removing bias from hiring algorithms, the ability to make AI forget specific information is crucial for privacy, fairness, and safety.\r\nI'll demonstrate some practical and theoretical Python approaches you can implement today:\r\n\r\n1. SISA Framework - Split training data into shards, making forgetting 5x faster than retraining fromscratch\r\n2. Gradient Ascent - Teach models to be confidently wrong about specific data \r\n3. Strategic Noise Injection - Add controlled noise to confuse AI about unwanted memories\r\n\r\nI'll explain the key concepts and walk through Python examples, showing how different unlearning approaches work in practice. While some advanced techniques exist, I'll focus on methods that are approachable for those getting started with machine learning.\r\n\r\nWhether you're building your first ML model or working on production systems, understanding machine unlearning helps you create more ethical and privacy-conscious AI. You'll leave with practical code examples, resources for further learning, and a new perspective on responsible AI development.\r\nYou just need curiosity about making AI more trustworthy and accountable.",

I learned this firsthand while building a production application, where the project\u2019s size and complexity pushed my debugging skills to the limit.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will break down a beginner-friendly toolkit for finding and fixing bugs in Python. We\u2019ll start with making sense of error messages and learning how to read a traceback without panicking. Attendees will explore how to use tools like print() and assert strategically, and why exceptions and logging can be lifesavers when things go wrong.\r\n\r\nWe will also tackle common beginner pitfalls, from harmless typos to sneaky logical errors, and share practical techniques for spotting them faster.\r\n\r\nBy the end, attendees will walk away not just knowing how to debug, but with the confidence to face errors head-on, whether working on a small script or a large project.",
